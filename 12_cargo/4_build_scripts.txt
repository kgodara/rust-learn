If your crates requires some prerequisites to compile, such as code generation or native compilation, a build script can be added to cargo.

Build scripts can be either added to the Cargo.toml as follows:

[package]
...
build = "build.rs"

Or, provided in a build.rs file which Cargo will automatically look for.

A build script is just a file that is compiled and run before compilation for the crate begins.

Cargo provides the build script with certain environment variables.

Lines printed from the build script and prefixed with `cargo:` will be interpreted directly by Cargo and can be used to define parameters for compilation.
